ðŸš€ Learning in Progress: Frontend Development Journey ðŸŽ¯

As part of my journey in learning Frontend Web Development, Iâ€™ve been exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” and I recently completed a minor project: a fully functional Tic Tac Toe Game! ðŸŽ®

This project helped me understand:
âœ… DOM Manipulation
âœ… Event Handling
âœ… CSS Flexbox for layout
âœ… Writing interactive logic in JavaScript

Itâ€™s a small step, but a big boost to my confidence and skills. Excited to keep building and growing in this path! ðŸ’»ðŸŒ±
